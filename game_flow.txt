--Ideas on how to run the game play simulation--

Stage 0

Players will be assigned roster spots on their team.

The roster spots will look like this, where (*) indicates required:

1 - Starting Guard*
2 - Starting Guard*
3 - Starting Forward*
4 - Starting Forward*
5 - Starting Center*
6 - Sixth Player (Any Position)*
7 - Bench Guard 1
8 - Bench Guard 2
9 - Bench Forward 1
10 - Bench Forward 2
11 - Bench Center

The team score is the average of the stats of all the rostered players on the team.

Starting Positions that have no backup (Bench/Sixth Player) slots filled of the same Position
will receive a penalty of -4 to CON and -2 to all other stats
to be calculated before the team score average. 

Positions with all Bench slots filled will receive a bonus of +4 to CON
and +2 to all other stats to be calculated before the team score average.
